## PCORnet CDM

Version 6.1 of the PCORnet common data model has been released by PCORI in April 2023 in both PDF and "parseable" MS Excel formats, but without database definition language for specific implementation. The DDL contained here represents an interpretation of the released materials, translated into several database dialects for the use of PEDSnet members. The full released documentation on the PCORnet CDM can be found in the [docs](docs) directory.

### Database Dialects

DDL scripts for creating the PCORnet CDM  are available [here](https://data-models-sqlalchemy.research.chop.edu/pcornet). Please navigate to the latest release.

These scripts were generated by creating a declarative representation of the CDM using [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) syntax (in [sqlalchemy_cdm_tables.py](sqlalchemy_cdm_tables.py)) and programmatically converting it into dialect-specific DDL. For this reason, the scripts are not yet fully tested. Please report any issues [here](https://github.com/PCORnet/Data_Models/issues).

### Interpretations of PCORnet CDM

1. Where `TEXT(x)` appears as a data type in the PCORnet CDM specification, it has been interpreted as `VARCHAR` (or equivalent) type with a max length of 1028 characters.
2. Primary key constraints have been added to all tables, using the fields mentioned as unique for each table in the specification (SQLAlchemy table definitions require a primary key).
3. No constraints or checks have been added to enforce the formatting or value sets declared on columns in the specification (this is an area for possible future improvement).
