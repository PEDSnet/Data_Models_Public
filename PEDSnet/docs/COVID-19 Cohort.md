# COVID-19 Cohort ETL Guidance 

## Background

The COVID-19 pandemic presents a “100 year” challenge to public health, threatening mortality into the hundreds of thousands and severe socioeconomic dislocation.  Although children as a group appear to be less severely affected than older patients, but many important questions remain unanswered.  Little is known about risk factors for severe illness, particularly in young infants, immunocompromised children, and children with chronic pulmonary disease.  Moreover, the role children with mild infection play in transmission, both in the community and in the pediatric workforce, is not well understood.

Recognizing this need, PEDSnet is committing to a rapid response that creates the data substrate for COVID-19 analyses and for pragmatic research, and that builds a pediatric research effort to complement current efforts in basic and adult clinical domains.


## Inclusion Criteria

Both clinical diagnostics and data collection regarding COVID-19 is in flux. In order to capture patients, we will define this cohort with a focus on sensitivity.

Patients should be included they were:
 
 <ul><li>Diagnosied with COVID-19 (determined by institutional mechanisms) ***OR*** </li>
 <li>Tested for SARS-CoV-2 ***OR***</li>
 <li>Seen in the Emergency Department (ED) or inpatient setting since Jan 01, 2020 with acute respiratory illness (excluding exacerbation of known chronic conditions such as asthma)</li></ul>



## Vocabulary Updates and Snapshot

Standaridized codes have been rapidly developed to support the identification and coding of covid-19 realted diagnosis, outcomes and testing.

#### Diagnosis Codes

A **snapsho**t of the vocabulary (an update to the current vocabulary) is available [here](**coming soon**). 

This is version [3.7.2](**coming soon**) of the vocabulary. 


## Data Submission

Using the data resource, we will maintain up to date **(weekly)** descriptions of the demographics and major clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cohorts, as well as an overall picture of health care utilization, to inform public health and health system responses.

Please utilize the PEDSnet data submission resource **transfer2.chop.edu** to submit the covid-19 cohort for your site. 

Please use the following convention for submission:
