# PEDSnet Vocabulary: vocabulary\_gpi\_addon

The `vocabulary_gpi_addon` schema contains terms and mappings incorporating the Medispan GPI drug description terminology into the OHDSI standard vocabulary.  The GPI vocabulary comprises propietary terms used by several PEDSnet sites that purchase the Medispan drug information product from Wolters-Kluwer.

The long-term process for maintaining this vocabulary is the subject of discussions among PEDSnet sites, the OHDSI vocabulary working group, and Wolters Kluwer.  In the interim, this vocabulary is managed by the DCC.

GPI concepts are drawn from an early version of the OHDSI version 5 vocabulary; concept IDs from this vocabulary remain reserved in the OHDSI assignment system.

Mappings from GPI concepts to standard RxNorm concepts are determined from the Medispan mapping licensed by participating PEDSnet institutions.  Pending development of a long-term process with OHDSI, these are updated on an ad-hoc basis.

Due to possible licensing requirements, the GPI-related sections of the vocabulary are released separately for use by PEDSnet sites licensing Medispan from Wolters Kluwer.  Unlike other supplements, it is not merged into the main vocabulary prior to a release.  A separate relase file is compiled in a manner parallel to that described in the main [release management](PEDSnet_vocabulary_release_management.md) document.
