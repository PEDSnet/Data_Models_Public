# PEDSnet CDM V2 DDL and Documentation

### DDL files

The CDM V2 DDL scripts are organized by DBMS. Within each DBMS-specific directory, there are separate scripts to create tables, constraints, and indexes, as well as load the vocabulary data (which can be downloaded seperately [here](https://github.com/PEDSnet/Data_Models/tree/master/PEDSnet#omop-v5-vocabulary-for-version-2)).

### Documentation

CDM documentation, including the conventions document, are available in the [docs](docs) folder.
